                    <h3>WARTHOGS</h3>
                    <p>Warthogs are sparsely-haired wild pigs found across sub-Saharan Africa. These unique animals have large heads and bodies with short legs, coarse manes down their backs, and long, thin tails they hold upright when running. Their most distinctive features are the large bumps on their faces that look like wartsâ€”hence their name.
                    </p>
                    <p>There are two warthog species, the widespread common warthog and the desert warthog. Common warthogs have larger tusks and more extensive manes than their desert cousins, and are commonly found across sub-Saharan Africa in open plains, grassland savannahs, and woodlands. Desert warthogs, on the other hand, have longer legs and less body fat, which makes them well adapted to the drier conditions of semi-arid regions of Somalia, Ethiopia, and Kenya.
                    </p>
                    <p>Warthogs play important roles in the ecosystems of African savannahs and grasslands. As grazers, they aerate the soil with their snouts while scavenging for food, which supports plant growth. Their abandoned burrows provide homes for other wildlife, while the parasites that live on their skin provide food for birds. Warthogs are also key prey for lions, leopards, hyenas, and wild dogs, helping support these predator populations.</p>
                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the warthogs at enclosure C6, sandwiched between the daycare, spa, and tigers. </p>
