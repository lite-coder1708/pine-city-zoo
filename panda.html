                    <h3>GIANT PANDA</h3>
                    <p>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), also known as the panda bear or simply panda, is a bear species endemic to China. It is characterised by its white coat with black patches around the eyes, ears, legs and shoulders.
                    </p>
                    <p>The giant panda lives exclusively in six montane regions in a few Chinese provinces at elevations of up to 3,000 m (9,800 ft). It is solitary and gathers only in mating seasons. It relies on olfactory communication to communicate and uses scent marks as chemical cues and on landmarks like rocks or trees. Females rear cubs for an average of 18 to 24 months. The oldest known giant panda was 38 years old.
                    </p>
                    <p>As a result of farming, deforestation and infrastructural development, the giant panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived. You can help save the pandas by donating in the Save-A-Panda donation box near the enclosure.</p>
                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the pandas at pen B1, right next to the restaurants. </p>
