                    <h3>MONKEY TRAIL</h3>
                    <p>If the name wasn't obvious enough, it's a trail inhabited by monkeys.
                    </p>
                    <p>PLEASE DON'T FEED THE MONKEYS
                    </p>
                    <p>The monkeys may occasionally try to accost you or your companions. You have full discretion to fight back but the zoo will not be held liable for zoo-like behaviour.</p>
                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU IT</p></strong>
                    <p>Look around. If your eyes fail you, use your ears, monkeys aren't exactly quiet.</p>
