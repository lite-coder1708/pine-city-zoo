                    <h3>AMPHITHEATRE</h3>
                    <p>Educational lessons on animals for all our guests. Because knowledge is power!
                    </p>
                    <p>We stopped hiring experts after it became clear guests weren't interested so you can find some failed motivational speakers on stage, who occasionally read the material we provide.
                    </p>
                    <p>If your attention span isn't big enough to sit through a 15 min talk, be mature enough to exit the venue before the talk commences.</p>
                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND IT</p></strong>
                    <p>The amphitheatre can be found above the tiger enclosure. </p>
