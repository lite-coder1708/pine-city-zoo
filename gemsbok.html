                    <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                    <p>The gemsbok (Oryx gazella), or South African oryx, is a large antelope in the genus Oryx. It is endemic to the dry and barren regions of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and (parts of) Zimbabwe, mainly inhabiting the Kalahari and Namib Deserts, areas in which it is supremely adapted for survival. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Gemsbok are widely hunted for their spectacular horns that average 85 cm (33 in) in length. From a distance, the only outward difference between males and females is their horns, and many hunters mistake females for males each year. In males horns tend to be thicker with larger bases. Females have slightly longer, thinner horns.
                    </p>
                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the gemsbokke at pen G10, right next to the amphitheatre. </p>
